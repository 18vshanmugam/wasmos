# Kernel

This is the core of the OS. It contains a set of core packages. As of right now a kernel binary is statically compiled.

[Wasa](https://github.com/WebAssemblyOS/wasa) provides the AssemblyScript API for the kernel and a typescript interface for creating the corresponding assemblyscript imports.
